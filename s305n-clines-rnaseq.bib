	abstract = {Due to the importance of 4R tau (with four microtubule-binding-repeat domains) in the pathogenicity of primary tauopathies, it has been challenging to model these diseases in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)derived neurons, which express very low levels of 4R tau. To address this, we have developed a panel of isogenic iPSC lines carrying MAPT splice-site mutations, S305S, S305I, or S305N, derived from four different donors. All mutations signiÔ¨Åcantly increase 4R tau expression in iPSC neurons and astrocytes. Functional analyses of S305 mutant neurons reveal shared disruption in synaptic signaling and maturity but divergent effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics. In iPSC astrocytes, S305 mutations promote internalization of exogenous tau that may be a precursor to glial pathology. These lines recapitulate previously characterized tauopathy-relevant phenotypes and highlight functional differences between the wild-type 4R and the mutant 4R proteins in both neurons and astrocytes. As such, these lines enable a more complete understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying 4R tauopathies across different cell types.},
